Relational databases allow for constant time look ups between multiple tables using
defined table structures.  They are ridgid and it require very intense computations to 
add new migrations to large databases if you need to keep track of new data.  non relational
databases have no set structure so they can be modified on the fly but accessing your data
does not happen in constant time.
